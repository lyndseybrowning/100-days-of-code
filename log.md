# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up Node & Express template for Dictionary API. Created the module that handles Dictionary initialisation by reading in words from a text file and returning the number of words in a callback function.

**Thoughts:** Becoming more comfortable with asynchronous execution and passing callback methods. Would like to know more about Node and Express.
